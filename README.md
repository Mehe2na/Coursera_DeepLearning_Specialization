# Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera
## Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)
This repo contains all my work in the coursera specialization course I accomplished. 
## All the code base and images are taken from : [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).

## What I want to say 
As a CS student and and as a self-taught learner, I was able to complete this specialization thanks to the very rich content found there.
I posted the assignment solutions here, **only for reference purpose**, just to possibly help you save some time.
Programming assignments are very easy, just follow the instructions carefully
This course may seem very simple, but its simplicity lies in its content and structure.

This repo contains all the programming assignments
